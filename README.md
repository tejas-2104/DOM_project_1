# Change Div Styles Project

This project demonstrates how to dynamically change the styles of a div element using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Instructions

To view the hosted version of the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/tejas-2104/DOM_project_1.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd DOM_project_1



3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can view the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://tejas-2104.github.io/DOM_project_1/).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the target div element and linking to the JavaScript file.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file where the code for manipulating the div element's styles is written.

## How it Works

When you open `index.html` in a web browser, the JavaScript code in `script.js` is executed. This code retrieves the target div element using `getElementById` and then changes its styles using various `style` properties such as `backgroundColor`, `margin`, `padding`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `height`, and `width`.

## Rubrics Compliance

- The user interface (UI) remains consistent and visually appealing.
- Proper alignment and visually appealing elements ensure a pleasant user experience.
- The `getElementById` method is used to retrieve the target div element.
- The fetched element is stored in a variable for further manipulation.
- The background color of the div element is changed to yellow.
- Margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width of the div element are modified as specified.
- Detailed instructions are provided in the README for viewing the hosted version of the project.
- The hosted link to the live version of the project is included.
